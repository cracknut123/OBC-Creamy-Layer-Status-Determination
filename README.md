# OBC-Creamy-Layer-Status-Determination

Dear OBC Community Candidates, 

OBC applicants most of the times, do not have clarity on the **clause of applicability of Creamy Layer** and Non creamy Layer.  We simply go by the **crude understanding** of the  limits determined by the govt as Income and the popular metrics in media/limited knowhow of local advocates, etc. Many a times even the concerned officers Tehsildar etc. do not have this clarity / at least they protray that they do not have. 

There are multiple criterias( caveats), under which an "income" is to be calculated under the statutory limit for OBC or not. Such, final value of the income is to be compared under the Income Limit. 
**BEWARE- NOT ALL SALARY/AGRICULTURAL INCOME is included for this calculation.**

There are a series of official documents starting from the original GO( Government order) which establish and subsequently clarify the doubts in this matter. 

Since, i learned it the hard way, these  are my 2 bits for the community to save the same herculean task to establish and claim what has been established by law. 


First and foremost, **the status of creamy layer does not determine by YOUR income status**, rather than your **parents**. You may be earning crores in package/ already sitting on class A( the epitome of government service categorization) , it is immaterial for you, it would determins the status for your kids, not you. Your CL/NCL status depends on salary etc of your parents. 

Many applicants have either one or both of their parents working under Government /PSU jobs- ( my case lies under this- hence the analysis is mostly revolving arround this aspect)

There is a concept of **Income- Wealth test**, under which the income of Govt/PSU Salried parents are not clubbed under the statutory limit of 8 Lakh ( at present) to dermine OBC- CL/OBC NCL. It may be any number of lakhs. Because , salary of government employees is considered as a compensation of their work for the state, and thus not coundted as income. Instead, for the government employees(parents), the class of employment- i.e. Class 1, CLASS 2, CLASS 3 / CLASS 4 matters, whether they are among the highest epochs( like holding constitutional posts)/ their age when they entered into the particular clss of service( ex. of even one of your parents entered into a class A job before the age of 40, you are a Creamy layer candidate), etc. 

Additionally, any **income from agricultural soruces** ( unless it is a commercial plantation) is not considered for the calculation of the "Income", as agricultural activity is considered as a sustenance activity. 

Any **other income - house rent, stocks, capital gains, business income , professions salary**( Lawyer- private), Doctors- pvt. practice, CA etc is **verymuch  counted** under the income. 

Thus there are many criterias, as determined in the bare act/order and further clarifications and consolidations. 

I understand that it is very tough and highly unlikely to believe that such clauses even exists, but they do , and they are true. However, when I approached my tehsil for getting it accounted for, no body , just nobody from the Tehsildar to SDM was willing to enter into this discussion. Hence i made a notesheet which was used by the lower staff to be put forward to Tehsildar and further to SDM listing all facts and clearly determining what's is what. 

**{{A notesheet( a sequential document listing all facts and figures with proposal for an action- this is how work happens in government organizations)- I am already into a service, hence the insight}}**

With that Notesheet, i embedded the respective clause, interlinking with various documents published/issued by the departments/ DOPT etc, and furnishing my details of applicability/ non applicability as per the particular clause establishing my case. 

Ths document along with its supporting documents have been organized under following four docs, with placeholders to replace your correspnding information into it and utilize. However, it will certainly take time and effort to understand the clauses of the documents, as your confidence matters when you present a case. and that confidence comes when you are dead sure about what you are saying. 

And yes, I got the certificate issued, and further I have been sharing these docs to multiple tehsildars and SDM's of my area :D

Thankyou.
